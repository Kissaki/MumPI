# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

MumPI is no longer being actively developed. Reports and security-relevant change requests are still being handled though.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities through [the GitHub report vulnerability functionality](https://github.com/Kissaki/MumPI/security/advisories/new) (Repo -> Security -> Report a vulnerability).

Alternatively, you may contact me directly via my commit author email.

Even though I no longer use MumPI nor actively develop it I will do my best to respond to reports and with fixes in a timely manner.
